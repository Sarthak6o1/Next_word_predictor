# Next_word_predictor
LSTM model to predict next word of a sentecnce with Speech recognition. LSTM have more complex architecture to store long and short term memory through the forget gate deletion from long term memory input gate for updation of long term cell state and output gate for finding the hidden state output.They perform better than Recurrent Neural Networks
